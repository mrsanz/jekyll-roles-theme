The _Scribe_ ensures that meeting notes are taken and sends them out.

## Tasks

***During Meeting***

* [ ] Note the first names of each meeting attendee.
* [ ] Record a simple, short summary of each discussion in the **Key Points** section.
* [ ] Record all assignments in the **Assignments** section.

***Within 24 Hours of Meeting***

Part of your service as _Scribe_ is to summarize the key points of what was said enabling recipients to recall or learn the main points of the discussion.

- [ ] Clean up the notes into a cohesive record of the meeting.
- [ ] Announce in [chat]{:target="_blank"} that the notes are in the agenda document.
In your announcement include a sharing link to the document itself.
- [ ] Reply-all to the meeting invite with the notes from the meeting.
This email should include (in order):
  * Generic thank-you to meeting participants.
  * Link to the agenda document where the notes are located.
  * Notes from the agenda document.

## Tips

* Make sure the notes are clear and to the point.  A regular attendee should be able to understand what happened by reading the notes alone.
* Reserve your own time as close as possible to the end of the meeting, enabling you to clean up and send out the notes promptly.
