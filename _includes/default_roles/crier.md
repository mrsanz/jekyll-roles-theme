**Tips**

* Ensure that the announcement has enough information for people to join the meeting even if they don't have the calendar invite.
  - Meeting day/time
  - Call info
* Try to make the announcement engaging so that even people that have not participated before may be interested in joining.
A good way to do that is to incorporate interesting agenda items from the calendar invite into the announcement.
